# GAMA-Programming

Programming in Gama, also known as the "Gama Platform," is used to create multi-agent simulation models. These models can be employed to simulate and study various phenomena in fields such as biology, economics, ecology, sociology, etc. Multi-agent simulations model systems composed of autonomous entities called "agents" that interact with each other and their environment according to specific rules.

Programming in Gama involves defining the behavior of agents, their interactions, environment rules, and other simulation parameters. It often provides a specific syntax and tools to simplify the creation of complex simulation models. These models can then be used to analyze and understand the behavior of real or hypothetical systems, as well as to explore different scenarios and strategies.
